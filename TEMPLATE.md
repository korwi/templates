**One liner that explains it (this could otherwise be added on the title as "Project title: project subtitle")**

An introductory paragraph which will explain your project more concretely. It is here that you should add information about it's values against competitors, and this is where people will look for information so essential technical aspects must be said here. This paragraph also has SEO power so include the relevant keywords.
